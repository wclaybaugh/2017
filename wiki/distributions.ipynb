    "## Random Variables\n",
    "In discussing the rules of probability we encountered the notion of $\\Omega$, the set of all possible outcomes of a random process. \n",
    "\n",
    "To link the notion of events such as $E$ and collections of events, or *probability spaces* $\\Omega$ to data, we must introduce the concept of random variables. The following definition is taken from Larry Wasserman's All of Stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**. A random variable is a mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "that assigns a real number $X(\\omega)$ to each outcome $\\omega$. $\\Omega$ is the sample space. Points\n",
    "$\\omega$ in $\\Omega$ are called sample outcomes, realizations, or elements. Subsets of\n",
    "$\\Omega$ are called Events. Say $\\omega = HHTTTTHTT$ then $X(\\omega) = 3$ if defined as number of heads in the sequence $\\omega$.\n",

    "## A Note on Notation\n",

    "  P(X=k\\,|\\,N=n,P=p)=  \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{(n-k)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing here is that _events, and only events_ have probability. A probability distribution is the probability of each of various events (often given some pre-conditions or assumptions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower notation makes this explicit: It's the probability that X (standing for the number of heads we _might_ observe) takes a particular value k (e.g. 5 heads), **given** that we are making n flips and the bias on the coin is p. It also gives us a plug-in formula to compute such a probability, and every value used in the formula is put either before the bar (random, part of the probability, value not yet set) or after the bar (has a known value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, we know that an integral over all values of k will give 1, and an intergral over the other parameters almost certainly will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or one might see any of the following **conventions** or **abuses**:\n",

    "  P(X)\\\\\n",
    "  P(x)\\\\\n",
    "  P(X=x) = Binom(x;n,p)\\\\\n",

    "  X|N,P\\\\\n",
    "  X|n,p\\\\\n",
    "  P(x|Data)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you see any of the above, try and translate back to the explicit situaiton above: what is given/known/behind the bar, what is random/unknon/ahead of the bar, and what values does each thing take? For instance, $P(x|Data)$ means to be $p(X=x|Data=observed\\ data)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "Any capital letter like $X$ is a random variable. It's some quantity that can take on multiple possible values. We can talk about the probability of it taking on some value $x$ or $k$ or $5$. And, below, we can make graphs that show the probability of $X=k$ or $X\\le k$ for various values of k."
