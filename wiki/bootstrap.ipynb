    "Just having an estimate is no good. We will want to put confidence intervals on the estimation of the parameters. This presents a conundrum: we have access to only one sample, but want to compute a error estimate over multiple samples, using an estimator such as the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we are wishing for the Lord  to have given us other samples drawn from the population. But alas, no such luck...\n",
    "\n",
    "So how then are we to find the sampling distribution of our parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two decades, **resampling** the ONE dataset we have has become computationally feasible. Resampling involves making new samples from the observations, each of which is analysed in the same way as out original dataset. One way to do this is the Bootstrap. "
