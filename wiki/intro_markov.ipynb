    "### Intuition\n",
    "It should be clear that the long-run distribution is sepcial in that once we reach it we don't leave. In essence, the number of cars folowing out of any given airport is equal to the number of cars flowing in to that airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of cars flowing out of a node depends on its row of the transition matrix [which can't change] and the number of cars present. Suppose that the number of cars coming in is more or less fixed (75), and that a location presently has 100 cars and loses 80% of them at each update. This location will lose 80 cars and gain 75, ending up at 95 in inventory. The next day it will only lose 76 cars (instead of the 80 it just lost) becuase it has a lower number of cars in stock. It will net lose one car this time, ending with a stock of 94.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be thought of almost like plumbing: the outflow from a node depends on the pipe sizes (transition probabilites), but also on the pressue at the node itself (number of cars present).\n",
    "\n",
    "Equilibrium occurs when losses match gains, in this case at 93.75 cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general situation is a little more detailed since inflow isn't static, but we can see why equilibria should occur and be stable: if stock is above equilibrium inflow the node will emit more cars than it takes in and head to stability; if stock is below equilibrium inflow it will take in more cars than it emits and head to stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, we'll develop precise conditions for equilibria to exist and be unique. It will boil down to \"no disconnected nodes\" and \"no deterministic loops\".\n",
    "\n",

    "### Zooming in\n",

    "It happened again! The Ferarri wandered along whatever particular path between the airports, but the time it spends at each airport matches the long-run distribution we found above.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to observe the ferrari's location over a large set of times (or a random set of times) we'll get back samples from the equilibrium distribution (airport 0 comes up half the time, etc).\n",

    "### Exploitation:\n",
    "Here, some very clever people had an idea. What if instead of just three states we had lots of states reprsenting, say, x-values instead of airports. We could cleverly rig up a transition matrix so that the long-term distribution is, say, a binomial distribution over those x values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to get a sample from the binomial we could just check in on the position of the ferarri at any given time!\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is sound, but there are implementation issues we must overcome. We'll need to figure out how to build such a clever transition matrix, and if we want to support continuous distributions we'll need to jump from a finite number of states to an infinite number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea: 'follow the ferrari', or less poetically, \"just pick a starting state and whack it with a well-chosen transition rule a few thousand times\" is the kernel of all of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, one of the most revolutionary ideas in computation."
