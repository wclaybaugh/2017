Yep, this is a ___ profile. My standard profile here, ____. I'm not trying to hide anything; I'm jut curious how things go
if we're willing to be indirectly honest about where we'd like things to end up. 

Please understand, though, that I'm picky. I go for brilliant and beautiful and a battle of wits with an armistice signed on bedsheets.
