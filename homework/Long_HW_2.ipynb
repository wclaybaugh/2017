    "## Problem 1. The Ising Model with Metropolis and Gibbs\n",
    "\n",
    "The true power of the Monte Carlo method becomes apparent when we deal with integrals over many dimensions, such as those often found in statistical physics. In this exercise we consider the 2-D Ising model, which is a very idealized representation of a ferromagnetic metal. The model consists of an $L\\times L$ lattice of spins  $s_{ij}$ (with $i, j = 1, \\ldots , L$) each of which can take only two values, up (s$_{ij}$ = 1) and down (s$_{ij}$ = -1). The total energy for the system is taken to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = -\\sum_{ij} \\frac{1}{2} s_{ij}  \\left[ s_{\\rm{up}(ij)} + s_{\\rm{down}(ij)} + s_{\\rm{left}(ij)} + s_{\\rm{right}(ij)} \\right],  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where s$_{\\rm{up}(ij)}$ denotes the spin immediately above s$_{ij}$ in the grid, s$_{\\rm{right}(ij)}$ the spin immediately to its right, and so on. We see that configurations in which nearby spins are aligned are energetically preferred. When the system is in thermal equilibrium, at the temperature $T$, the probability of finding it in a given configuration $\\{s\\}=(s_{11}, s_{12}, \\ldots)$ of the spins is given by the Boltzmann factor,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W(\\{{s} \\}) = Z^{-1} e^{ -\\beta E[ \\{ s \\} ] }, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z$ is given by the sum of the exponential over all possible spin configurations, and where $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature (measured in units of the Boltzmann constant $k_B$). The thermal equilibrium values of all the macroscopic quantities for the system (such as the magnetization, $M(\\{s\\}) =\\sum_{ij} s_{ij}$ are found by averaging over all spin configurations, weighted by $W$. For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left< M \\right> := \\sum_{\\{s\\}} W(\\{{s} \\})M(\\{s\\})\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left< M \\right> = \\sum_{s_{11}=\\pm 1} \\sum_{s_{12}=\\pm 1} \\ldots \\sum_{s_{LL}=\\pm 1} \\left[ W(\\{s\\}) \\times \\sum_{ij} s_{ij} \\right],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Computing thermal equilibrium values using the above equation is effectively out of the reach of standard techniques, but not so if we use Monte Carlo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling: Metropolis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis algorithm generates a sequence of configurations that have approximately the required probability distribution. This is how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We start with a completely random spin configuration $\\{s \\}$ (each spin chosen to be up or down with 50% probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "* To generate the next configuration in the sequence, we select a point $(i, j$) in the lattice, and we compute the energy change $\\Delta E$ by flipping the corresponding spin, s$_{ij}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta E = 2s_{ij}  \\left[ s_{\\rm{up}(ij)} + s_{\\rm{down}(ij)} + s_{\\rm{left}(ij)} + s_{\\rm{right}(ij)} \\right]  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* if E is zero or negative, we accept the flip (i.e., we always accept changes that lower the total energy). If E is positive, we accept the flip with probability \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P (\\Delta E) = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E).$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat this Metropolis step L $\\times$ L times, once for each location $(i, j)$ in the lattice (the repeated Metropolis steps constitute a Metropolis sweep). The updated points are used as they become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling: Gibbs\n",
    "Since the spins are correlated with their neighbors, it is perhaps more natural to adopt a Gibbs approach. If we select a node $s_{ij}$ in the lattice, it is easy to show using the equations above that the full conditional probability of it having a spin of 1 given all the other spins is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(s_{ij}=1\\vert\\textrm{all other spins}) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(-2\\beta(s_{\\rm{up}(ij)} + s_{\\rm{down}(ij)} + s_{\\rm{left}(ij)} + s_{\\rm{right}(ij)})\\right)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the Gibbs model is to loop over each spin in the lattice, and with the above probability set the current spin to 1, otherwise setting it to −1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo\n",
    "Regardless of the sampling method, the Monte Carlo estimate of the ensemble average of a macroscopic quantity (say M) is then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left< M \\right> = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\sum_{ij} s_{ij}^{(k)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ s_{ij}^{(k)}$ is the sequence of the spin configurations obtained as usual by evolving the Markov Chain from the initial configuration. And as usual, its best to omit a certain number of configurations at the beginning of the sequence; these are not distributed with the proper probabilities, because the system has not yet reached thermal equilibrium (stationarity). How long the system takes to thermalize depends on several factors, and the length of the required warm-up period is usually estimated empirically."
